Project Description - Math Hopperations

    This game is about solving math problems. There would be 3 level of difficulties in this game, such as Easy, Medium and Hard. The player will choose the answer for each questions. The player will carefully choose the correct answer for each level. Pretty simple and fun.

Game Logic

    -A player will decide which level they want to play. 
    -Once the player picked the level they want the player will start answering the math problems for that level using the frog, who will be jumping on a leaf with an answer on it. 
    -When the player picks the correct answer it will turn green and show if they picked the answer correctly.
    -When the player picks the wrong answer the button will turn red, which shows the correct answer.
    -When the player finishes answering all the questions the button "restart" will show or the player can go back to the main page to choose another level.
