Project Description - Save the Frog

    This game is about solving math problems using a frog (the main character of the game). There would be 3 level of difficulties in this game, such as Easy, Medium and Hard. The player will choose the answer for each questions. The player will carefully choose the correct answer for each level, in order to move forward. Pretty simple and can be kids-friendly.

Game Logic

    -A player will decide which level they want to play. 
    -Once the player picked the level they want the player will start answering the math problems for that level using the frog, who will be jumping on a leaf with an answer on it. 
    -When the frog picks the correct answer it will move to the next question, which helps them complete the level.
    -When the frog picks the wrong answer the leaf will disappear in the water, which tells the player it's wrong. 
    -The frog will go back to the last question they left off, but cannot move forward until the answer is correct.
